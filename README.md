placeallder
===========

A polyfill for placeholder functionality that doesn't muck with your value attributes.

NOTE: This was a bit ambitious.  I was trying to get all browsers to work perfectly etc.  I wasn't happy with the ones I found at the time particularly because they were messing with values etc.

This has been implemented in most browsers of import by now.  So not working on it anymore.
